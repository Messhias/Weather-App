# Full NodeJS Weather APP

This project was created using NodeJS for backend + PostGres and ReactJS for UI.

Each project inside their folders [backend]() and [frontend]() it'll have 
they respective README's.

### Considerations

This app was created from scratch using NodeJS and ReactJS, so if you see 
something does not fit the community code standards or any issues please
 don't hesitate to open a issue or comment directly on comments section of
 each file.
 
 If do that it'll help me a lot as programmer and person to get better than now.
